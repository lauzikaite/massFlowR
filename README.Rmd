# massflowR

Package for pre-processing of high-resolution, untargeted, centroid LC-MS data.

# Overview

`massflowR` implements pre-processing in two major steps:

1. Pre-processing of individual datafiles - either in real-time of acquired datafiles one-by-one, or in parallel using backend provided by the `BiocParallel` package:
  + Datafiles  are pick-peaked using the *centWave* algorithm [package `xcms`].
  + Picked peaks are grouped into **components**.
  + Components are grouped into **clusters**.

2. Grouping of picked peaks by sample run order


# Installation
